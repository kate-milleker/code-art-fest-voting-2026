Each flower is coded with randomized petals so no two are the same, just like my family's stories. The process of creating this was a journey of technical growth. Before Code/Art, I thought coding was just about getting a computer to do math, but I discovered that programming is actually a canvas. I can use variables, loops, and functions just like a traditional artist uses paint and brushes. For this project, I wanted to create something that truly represented who I am and where I come from. Translating my paper sketches into a coordinate plane in p5.js was challenging. I had to calculate exact x and y positions, understand how shapes overlap using z-indexing, and use trigonometry like sine and cosine to create natural, flowing movements. Incorporating interactivity was another major milestone.
